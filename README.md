# 8X8RAM
It's a digital circuit of 8X8 RAM implemented on proteus professional software. The circuit is working properly and working properly with read and write operations.

The whole circuit of the 8X8 RAM looks like.

# 1 bit Logic of Ram circuit
we have here 3 input pins 1. i/p 2. select 3. read/write and one output and a SR flipflop.
through this circuit we are creating the logic of the RAM.

# Decoder circuit
As we want to implement the 8X8 RAM so we want 8 select lines for that so for the 8 select lines we are using 3X8 Decoder.As we have the 3 i/p.

# to use this circuit just download and use it on proteous 8.13 and above versions and to read the value use the Read/Write=1 and for the write use Read/Write =0.
